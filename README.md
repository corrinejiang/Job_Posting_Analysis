## Problem Statement

We, as McGill MMA students, are in the middle of the job searching process. But our time and energy are running out, while the data-related job market is burgeoning and confusing. Therefore, we need a 'job search strategy to bring about our desired future (a new job) while efficiently and effectively using resources (our time and energy). The confusing nature of the data job market comes from the fact that data careers are newly introduced, so many companies have their own different definitions of data experts' roles and responsibilities in their organizations. Therefore, our team wanted to mine 'tangible criteria for job searching' from job posts text analysis, as breaking down the job market, for us to understand the market landscape better, and navigate it more efficiently.

In the following analysis, we will address the two key questions to tackle the problem:

* Which job positions should we apply for when considering our skillsets?
    * What kind of differences exists between different data-related positions, such as data analyst, data scientist, and business analyst?
* Which industry can we possibly target when searching for a job?
    * Which industry has the most demand for data-related positions?
    * Which industries have the highest similarity regarding the requirement of data-related positions so that we can target concurrently?
